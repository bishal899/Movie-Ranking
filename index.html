                 <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooIc3dMncc">Your Name</a> :</h3>

               <p>This is one of my favourite movie. The visuals and musics are awesome. It crafts an extremely beautiful story about longing and loss; and that's not even bringing the artwork into account. Many movies are about emotions that have already manifested themselves, but Your Name centers in on the emotions that you don't have.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <img src="images/parasite-img.jpg" alt="parasite-movie">
              <p>This is another one of my favourite movie. The film does an exceptional job in showing the ways that those who are impoverished are treated poorly in subtle ways, and the effect that it has on them is greater than many would assume.

              <p>The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about hope, emotion, and friendship. The story tells about the unjust experiences in the protagonist's life and how he still battles them with hope and patience. The bond between the characters, Andy and Red, is remarkable. They make the movie an effortless watch.</p>
